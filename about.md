Here is a blog site containing some random information about my research, 
probably also notes for my hobby projects and some other stuff. I write 
this blog mostly with the intention of documenting some useful information 
for myself, but also hope these lines of texts could be somewhat useful 
to others.

Currently I am doing Computer Science related research with a focus on 
computer hardwares/accelerators, FPGAs, datacentre network and a little bit 
of network security. My major ongoing project is about distributed network 
file system and SmartNICs.

Personally, I am also interested in playing with electronics, from analogue 
stuff e.g. audio amplifiers to digital ones e.g. microcontrollers, from coding 
to PCB designing and soldering. My family and undergraduate education in EE 
certainly helped me a lot in this direction.

I probably will not post stuff here often, but will certainly share those 
that I find them cool.
